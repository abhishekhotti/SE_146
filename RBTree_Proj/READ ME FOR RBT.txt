Hello,

This is the project submission for Project 3 Red-Black Tree implementation. One thing which pops up when you run my program 
is you get a popup from Eclipse asking for permission to access incoming connections. I do not know why it does this, and 
I have asked David, and he does not know either. But I just hit allow, and the program runs. 

So, the poem file is called HottiAbhishekPoem.txt, right now the poem I have in there is The Raven by Edgar Allen Poe. 
You can copy and paste any poem into this text file and it will run. The dictionary is read in from dictionary.txt. 

In the console window, the time to read in the dictionary is displayed first, then the time to check all the words in 
the poem with the dictionary is displayed, and then the words that were not found in the dictionary are displayed. 

The splitting of words is done by this way, "don't" is counted as one word, bob-had is counted as two words "bob" and "had".
Everything is displayed in lowerCase because it was easier to do the splitting if I considered everything as lowerCase letters.

Thank you

Abhishek Hotti
