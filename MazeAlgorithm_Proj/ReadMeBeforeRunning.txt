Hello,

I thought it would be a good idea to explain to you how to run my program and where you can expect to see the output. 

So, if you run my JUnit class called, MazeTester.java, you will get an print out to the console window asking you to pick a value between 4 - 20 inclusive. If you pick a value outside the value, the program will prompt you to pick again. If you pick any negative value, the program will stop. So, once you select an appropriate value, the program will run and will check against the txt files already created. The output of the program with the matrix size you inputted will be displayed in a txt file called "solvedMaze.txt", which is in the Proj_2 folder. I have only created test txt files for values between 4 and 20, any value other than that will not run. If after entering a value, you would like to see the program running, you can enter another integer value between 4 - 20, and the solvedMaze text file will update with the new matrix of size which you inputted. If once you are satisfied with my program, you can exit by entering a negative integer value.

Thanks
